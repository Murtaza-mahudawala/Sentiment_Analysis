I shouldnt have opened it, Mohammad said, adding that they were just two meters (about six and a half feet) from each other when the strike happened.Hassan was very brave. He wanted the world to see what was happening in northern Gaza, and he insisted on doing the job even though many of his colleagues were killed, Mohammad added.Israels military campaign in Gaza has killed a record number of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which reported on Friday that at least 128 journalists and media workers  mostly Palestinian  have been killed.""",Negative
Gazan family flee home for fourth time,"On Saturday, Israel sent tanks and infantry back into Jabaliya, north east of Gaza City, saying intelligence had indicated the presence of saboteurs and terrorist structures in the area.Once again urging civilians to move south, the IDF said the operation, the armys third in the Jabaliya area since the start of the war, would involve systematic strikes and the radical destruction of terrorist structures.
Four months after their last move, Asmaas family has returned to her grandparents house in nearby al-Nasr.Like many civilians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, theyre reluctant to move south, fearing that if they do they wont ever make it home.Despite Israeli assurances, Palestinians fear the army is planning to implement a plan, proposed by the former head of Israels national security council, to completely empty the northern Gaza Strip of civilians.The situation is getting so dangerous that we dont have so much hope that well go back, Asmaa messaged me earlier.As usual, when Israeli military operations get under way, the internet and phone signals are disrupted.I might get lost for some days.",Negative
Trump: Immigrants Have Brought Bad Genes Into The Country,"As part of his recent weekslong racist smear campaign, Trumps running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), falsely said Haitian immigrants had raised the infectious disease rate in Springfield, Ohio. And Trump has been touting his mass deportation agenda, which he says hell enact as soon as hes in office.How about allowing people to come through an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers? Trump told Hewitt, referring to the Biden administration. Many of them murdered far more than one person, and theyre now happily living in the United States. You know, now, a murderer, I believe this, its in their genes. And weve got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They left, they had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldnt be here that are criminals.The xenophobic claim that immigrants are genetically predisposed to committing violent crimes is shocking and false  but xenophobia is also a cornerstone of Trumps presidential campaign.Trumps numbers are based on heavily manipulated statistics about the criminal conviction records of people with cases in immigrationcourt  cases that span several decades, some long before President Joe Biden was in office, and which include people currently servingprison time.",Negative
Four people taken to hospital as Northern Ireland school bus overturns,"Four people have been taken to hospital after a school bus carrying 43 school pupils and a driver overturned in a field in County Down on Monday.Photographs on social media showed children in uniform walking from the blue doubledecker bus, which had a shattered windscreen.
The Northern Ireland ambulance service (NIAS) indicated most of the passengers had suffered minor injuries if any, such as cuts and bruises, with eight people requiring more serious medical treatment.In a later update, it said most were well enough to be discharged at the scene, which is near the towns of Donaghadee and Newtownards.A spokesperson said: Following a road traffic incident this afternoon in the Carrowdore area, the NIAS declared a major incident, based on the number of resources required to attend the incident.",Negative
Large French Alpine ski resort to close in face of shrinking snow season,"A large French Alpine ski resort has announced it is to close, citing a lack of funds to become a year-round destination, as low- and medium-altitude mountain areas around Europe struggle with a truncated season due to global heating and declining snowfalls.Local councillors voted not to reopen Alpe du Grand Serre in the Isère this winter, saying they could no longer pay for the mountain lifts or pay to complete a programme to diversify as an all-year tourist destination.The move will wipe out 200 jobs and hit businesses in the nearby village of La Morte, whose economy and population of 150 people depend on winter sports.A local sports shop owner, Lauranne Vincent, told France 3 television: We are devastated and shocked. Its a brutal decision coming two months before we were due to open. We were hoping the opposite would happen. We said all lights were green to go.Frédérique Laurence, the owner of a grocery shop in La Morte, added: Weve been left completely in the lurch. We still have loans to pay as weve only been here four years. Who will pay them? Our lives have been ruined. Thats what is going to happen to us.",Negative
Pakistan bans Pashtun group as government cracks down on dissent,"Pakistani authorities have unleashed a draconian crackdown on dissent, breaking up opposition protests with violence and mass arrests and banning a movement to promote the rights of the ethnic Pashtun community under terrorism laws.

Hundreds of riot police fired teargas and charged with batons as supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party of the incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, gathered to protest over the weekend in the cities of Islamabad and Lahore.

Dozens of PTI figures, including prominent leaders and lawyers, were arrested and hundreds more were charged under terrorism laws, with Khan among those named.

Khans supporters took to the streets to demand the release of their leader and to call for an independent judiciary. Khan, 71, has been held in jail since August 2023 on upwards of 100 charges of corruption and terrorism that he alleges are politically motivated. Khan was earlier sentenced to 10 years for leaking state secrets but the courts overturned the verdict.",Negative
The pain will never leave: Nova massacre survivors return to site one year on,"ne year ago, nearly 400 young Israelis were massacred at the site of the Nova music festival during the 7 October Hamas attack. As mourners gathered at the site of the festival to commemorate the victims on Monday, their low sobs and murmured prayers were punctuated by the sound of artillery and machine guns being fired by soldiers into nearby Gaza.

Perhaps no single scene across Israel more expressly exhibited the horrific violence meted out against hundreds of civilians by Hamas, and the subsequent ferocity of the Israeli response against that organisation and millions of people inside of Gaza.

Just days before relatives gathered here, Israel sent tanks back across the border into northern Gaza for the first time in months and distributed leaflets telling the remaining population, estimated in the hundreds of thousands, to evacuate to the south of Gaza to avoid being caught up in a new phase of the war.

And on Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in near-messianic terms about a war that he has justified by pointing to the 1,200 victims of the Hamas attack and declared them a justification for an ever-expanding conflict that Israel is fighting on seven fronts across the Middle East.",Negative
People hold me accountable for a fanatical rightwing government: Jewish Americans on how their lives have changed since 7 October,"since the 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 Israelis last year, Jewish Americans across generations and political divides have been pulled into a crisis unfolding half a world away. For some, witnessing Israels bombardment of civilians in Gaza has compelled them to protest in support of Palestinian rights. For others, a sense of growing antisemitism has created an atmosphere of isolation and unease in personal and professional circles. All describe navigating difficult conversations, grieving lost relationships and grappling with a painful new terrain.

The Guardian spoke with five Jewish Americans who reflected on how their lives have changed over the last year. Their words have been edited and condensed.",Negative
