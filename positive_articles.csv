"KoBold Metals, which uses AI to help find critical minerals for the energy transition, raises $491M","""KoBold uses artificial intelligence to sift through enormous amounts of data in a quest to find mineral deposits that can help drive the energy transition. In addition to copper, the company searches for lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Initially, the company was focused solely on discovery. Prospecting for minerals has historically been an endeavor fraught with risk. The rule of thumb is that for every 1,000 attempts to find a deposit, only about three tend to be successful. KoBold was betting that AI would be able to parse data and find trends that would lead to greater success rates.With the enormous copper deposit in Zambia, Kobold appears to have delivered on its early promise. The company has about 60 other exploration projects underway, and in a strategic shift, KoBold has said it intends to develop the Zambia resource itself, an undertaking that reportedly will cost around $2.3 billion. KoBoldÂ’s previous investors include Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma, Andreessen Horowitz, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.""",Positive
